Input format for the HeatMapMaker are Excel generated CSV files (flat text files where each
cell is seperated by a ";" symbol). The arrangement on the data sheet reflects the arrangement
on the generated heatmap.

The HeatMapMaker requires data naming. The input data sheet should look like this:


	opt.		first		second		third		...
	first		data		data		data		...
	second		data		data		data		...
	third		data		data		data		...
	...	

where first to third are meaningful data descriptions and data are numerical data.
opt. is an optional character which may be present but is ignored in the program.


See example_csv.csv for comparison. There are no limitations to the size of your data. :) (I hope)
